To help make Eclipse comfortable for BDD Gherkin syntax, there are plugins: 

1. Natural 0.9

Natural is a set of plugins providing a smooth experience in editing and maintaining BDD/ATDD files. The currently supported languages are Cucumber (Gherkin syntax) and JBehave, the latter still in early development stage.

2. Cucumber Eclipse Plugin



To run .feature tests, you can use many tools: from a command line, Eclipse, JUnit, Maven, and any developer programming software supporting Java. 

It's easy to read by any Team around the company that is taking part in creating/ accepting project requirements and acceptance criteria, but also ready to use by developers when writing automated test.
